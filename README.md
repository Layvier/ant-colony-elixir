# Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm

## Description
I built this project in order to learn elixir. It uses different aspect of the language and leverages Erlang's OTP for parallelism. 

I implemented the Ant System version of the ACO meta-heuristic (http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/MasterOpt/ACO_Intro.pdf).
